                <h2>Intro To Software Development</h2>
                <p>On Monday, I started with a chat with Sam outlining the basics of programming and my current
                    knowledge on
                    the topic. After this, I started to programme the basics of a website and recollect my past
                    experiences
                    with HTML. Also gauge how much of an understanding I had of programming.</p>

                <h2>How _Nology works</h2>
                <p>Wednesday started with a talent and coaches meeting where everyone from the talent and _nology team
                    update each other on what's happening. After this I attended a sable lesson led by Rob and I got an
                    understanding of what goes on in these lessons. After this I had a chat with Michael about what he
                    does
                    in data analytics, and also he showed me the _nology selection process. Later there was the Princeâ€™s
                    trust info session, which was informing people of the requirements needed to be in the running for a
                    place on the _nology course. Then to finish the day, I worked further on my project which I was
                    eventually going to present on my final day, <a href="#friday"> Friday</a>

                <h2>Project Work</h2>
                <p>I started with self-paced material and for this I worked on my project, it was this session where I
                    decided to make it more of a calendar/table layout. After this there was a mentor speaker speaking
                    to us
                    about the company she worked for and her experiences as a programmer. Then to finish the day I did a
                    further 2 hours of project work. </p>

                <p>On Friday, the day started with self-paced material for a couple of hours this was to help me start
                    on JavaScript. After this I joined a QBE sales chat with three people from QBE, folloing this I did
                    more JavaScript and started to work on small pieces of code. After this I started to implement some
                    of this JavaScript into my project and made a button, to finish my week I did the project delivery
                    summing up everything I had done. </p>
